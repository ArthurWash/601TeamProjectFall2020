#Definitions 

1. Branching is the idea of creating a copy of the code and then adding new code for a task on a branch, and allows you to merge branches together. For example, I will create a new branch for my task and then I will create a pull request to have my branch merged to the master branch.

#Steps to work with GIT

1. Create a project on WebStorm
2. Add Readme.md and .gitignore to the project files
3. Go to VCS->Import to Version Conotrol->Share on Github
4. Share it and make the first intial commit
5. Your partner needs to clone the repository
6. You need to add your partner's githubID to the project on github. On Github go to settings and then manage access, where you will click add collaborators to add them to the project. You use their GithubID
7. Once your partner clones the repository they need to create a branch, complete their task, and then push the branch to the repository. Note: if you get access denied then you have not been added as a collaborator to the repo.
8. Once you push the code branch up to GitHub then create a pull request to have the code merged and someone needs to merge it.
9. Once the code is merged then you need to pull the code by going to VCS. Manually edit the files on Github or on WebStorm.
